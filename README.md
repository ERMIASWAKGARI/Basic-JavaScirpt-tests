# Test Task Repository

## Task 1: Loops and Algorithms

### Algorithm - Factorial Calculation:

Write a JavaScript function named `calculateFactorial` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the factorial of `n`. Assume `n` is a non-negative integer.

### Algorithm - Fibonacci Series:

Write a JavaScript function named `generateFibonacciSeries` that takes an integer `num` as input and returns an array containing the Fibonacci series up to the `num`th element.

## Task 2: Objects

### Object - User Profile:

Create an object named `userProfile` with the following properties:

- `name` (string): Your name
- `age` (number): Your age
- `email` (string): Your email address

### Object - Book Inventory:

Create an object named `bookInventory` representing a library book inventory. Each property should represent a book with the following attributes:

- `title` (string)
- `author` (string)
- `pages` (number)
- `available` (boolean)

## Task 3: DOM Manipulation

### DOM - Toggle Visibility:

Create an HTML file with a button element having an id of "toggleButton" and a div element with an id of "content". When the button is clicked, toggle the visibility of the content div (i.e., if it's visible, hide it; if it's hidden, show it).

### DOM - Form Validation:

Create an HTML form with fields for "username" and "password", along with a submit button. Using JavaScript, validate that both fields are filled out when the submit button is clicked. If either field is empty, display an appropriate error message.

### DOM - Dynamic Content Creation:

Create an HTML file with an empty div element having an id of "dynamicContent". Using JavaScript, dynamically create and append five paragraph elements to the div. Each paragraph should contain a unique message or text.

## Task 4: Error Handling

### Error Handling - Division by Zero:

Write a JavaScript function named `divide` that takes two parameters `a` and `b` and returns the result of dividing `a` by `b`. Handle the case where `b` is 0 gracefully by throwing an appropriate error message.

### Error Handling - JSON Parsing:

Attempt to parse an invalid JSON string "{'name': 'John', 'age': 30}" using `JSON.parse()`. Wrap the parsing code in a try-catch block to handle any errors. If successful, log the parsed object to the console; if an error occurs, log "Error: Invalid JSON string!".
