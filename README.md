# Test Task Repository

## Task 1: Loops and Algorithms

### Algorithm - Factorial Calculation:

Write a JavaScript function named `calculateFactorial` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the factorial of `n`. Assume `n` is a non-negative integer.

### Algorithm - Fibonacci Series:

Write a JavaScript function named `generateFibonacciSeries` that takes an integer `num` as input and returns an array containing the Fibonacci series up to the `num`th element.

## Task 2: Objects

### Object - User Profile:

Create an object named `userProfile` with the following properties:

- `name` (string): Your name
- `age` (number): Your age
- `email` (string): Your email address

### Object - Book Inventory:

Create an object named `bookInventory` representing a library book inventory. Each property should represent a book with the following attributes:

- `title` (string)
- `author` (string)
- `pages` (number)
- `available` (boolean)

## Task 3: DOM Manipulation

### DOM - Toggle Visibility:

Create an HTML file with a button element having an id of "toggleButton" and a div element with an id of "content". When the button is clicked, toggle the visibility of the content div (i.e., if it's visible, hide it; if it's hidden, show it).

### DOM - Form Validation:

Create an HTML form with fields for "username" and "password", along with a submit button. Using JavaScript, validate that both fields are filled out when the submit button is clicked. If either field is empty, display an appropriate error message.

### DOM - Dynamic Content Creation:

Create an HTML file with an empty div element having an id of "dynamicContent". Using JavaScript, dynamically create and append five paragraph elements to the div. Each paragraph should contain a unique message or text.

## Task 4: Error Handling

### Error Handling - Division by Zero:

Write a JavaScript function named `divide` that takes two parameters `a` and `b` and returns the result of dividing `a` by `b`. Handle the case where `b` is 0 gracefully by throwing an appropriate error message.

### Error Handling - JSON Parsing:

Attempt to parse an invalid JSON string "{'name': 'John', 'age': 30}" using `JSON.parse()`. Wrap the parsing code in a try-catch block to handle any errors. If successful, log the parsed object to the console; if an error occurs, log "Error: Invalid JSON string!".

### Viewing the Code

You can download and view the working code by following these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/ERMIASWAKGARI/Basic-JavaScirpt-tests.git
```

2. Open the downloaded repository in your preferred code editor.

3. For HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, you can use a live server extension (such as Live Server for Visual Studio Code) to view the code in action. Simply open the HTML file in your code editor and start the live server. You'll be able to interact with the code and see the results in your browser in real-time.
